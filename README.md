Dataset Description

The dataset credit_card_fraud.csv includes the following columns:

    trans_date_trans_time: Transaction date and time
    merchant: Merchant name
    category: Category of the merchant
    amt: Amount of the transaction
    city: City of the credit card holder
    state: State of the credit card holder
    lat: Latitude location of the purchase
    long: Longitude location of the purchase
    city_pop: Population of the card holder's city
    job: Job of the credit card holder
    dob: Date of birth of the credit card holder
    trans_num: Transaction number
    merch_lat: Latitude location of the merchant
    merch_long: Longitude location of the merchant
    is_fraud: Indicates whether the transaction is a fraud (1) or not (0)

Analysis Overview

The analysis involves loading the dataset using pandas, exploring fraudulent transactions, and identifying patterns related to fraudulent activities. We utilize various pandas functionalities to manipulate the data, including grouping, filtering, and aggregating. The analysis also involves visualizing the distribution of fraudulent transactions across different categories, states, and age groups of card holders.

Key insights are drawn from the data, such as the most common categories and states for fraudulent transactions, as well as the age group most associated with fraud. Additionally, the analysis includes geographical visualization of fraud rates across states using Plotly, providing a clear visual understanding of fraud distribution in the dataset.
